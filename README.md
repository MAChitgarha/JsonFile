JsonFile helps you playing with JSON files. Built on top of [Json](https://github.com/machitgarha/jsonfile).

## No Longer Maintained

This repository is no longer maintained, and is deprecated, due to the deprecation of the upstream [Json](https://github.com/machitgarha/jsonfile) package (see the README.md of the repository for more details). Its use is highly discouraged.

Feel free to open an issue, if you think the library should be maintained.

You can use [Webmozart Json](https://github.com/webmozart/json) instead.
